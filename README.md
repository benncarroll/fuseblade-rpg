# FuseBlade
Carroll & Karozis

### A tile-based game for our 2018 11SDD Assessment.

Our plan for the game is to make a basic RPG with modern technologies that will make it easily expandable in the future. For the graphic element, we plan to go for a simplistic spritesheet that will be able to flow and connect cleanly without an excess of detail. Our game will run in a browser on a JavaScript base.
