## How to get going:

Hey there - welcome to our repo!

- You’ll find all the theory work in Theory/theory.pdf
- You’ll find the working game at phaser/index.html
  - Note, web server required
  - If you don’t have a web server readily available, head to [https://bencarroll.tech/projects/fuseblade/phaser][1]
  - If something seems super broken or it won't start, clear your local storage and quickly reload

### A tile-based game for our 2018 11SDD Assessment.

Our plan for the game is to make a basic RPG with modern technologies that will make it easily expandable in the future. For the graphic element, we plan to go for a simplistic spritesheet that will be able to flow and connect cleanly without an excess of detail. Our game will run in a browser on a JavaScript base.
